# Advanced AI-Driven Defect Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Advanced AI-Driven Defect Detection System. This project aims to revolutionize quality assurance in automotive manufacturing by implementing a state-of-the-art AI system that identifies defects in vehicle components with high accuracy. Our goal is to minimize defects, reduce costs associated with rework and recalls, and ensure that every vehicle component meets the highest standards of quality.

## Features

- **High Accuracy Defect Detection**: Utilizes advanced AI models to detect defects in automotive parts with exceptional accuracy.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes images and data in real-time to provide instant feedback on potential defects.
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces costs associated with rework, recalls, and warranty claims by ensuring only high-quality components move forward in the manufacturing process.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable across various types of automotive parts and manufacturing setups.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for operators and quality assurance personnel to interact with the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-defect-detection.git
    cd ai-defect-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Navigate to the `car-part-models.ipynb` notebook and open it.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of automotive part images.
2. Load the dataset into the notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the AI model, and perform defect detection.
4. Analyze the results and adjust the model parameters as needed.
